The linear svm classifier has not been meddled with (default settings)

sigma = 2, dimension = 75 => error = 36%
sigma = 4, dimension = 75 => error = 9.81%
sigma = 10, dimension = 75 => error = 8.71%
sigma = 10, dimension = 60 => error = 9.41%
sigma = 10, dimension = 45 => error = 9.915%
sigma = 20, dimension = 75 => error = 10.19%
sigma = 50, dimension = 75 => error = 15.19%
